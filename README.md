# Dichroic-CD-model
Dichroic CD model for fitting observed ellipticities

Both folders (Q_total and Q_double_H) should be in the same directory as main script (single_fit_dichroic_estimator.py).

Three inputs are needed:
1) N- chain lenght in residues (up to 32)
2) temperature in Â°C
3) molar ellipticity: in deg cm2 dmol-1 per peptide unit

Program returns propagation parameter w and fractional helicity (<fH>.
